:Description:  3D printable shell models for the Lecroy 93xx series oscilloscope. The quadrant models were generated using FreeCAD RealThunder, a Fusion360 variant is also available; but I haven't printed them.

:Printing: I used a Bambu P1S printer with PETG HF filament from Bambu Labs. All but the lower front quadrants were printed on thier backs. The lower front quadrants were printed on thier sides.
